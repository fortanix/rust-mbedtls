//! MbedTLS self tests.
//!
//! Calling MbedTLS self test functions before they're enabled using the
//! `enable()` function here will result in a panic.
//!
//! Using this module in multithreaded or async environment will fail. The self 
//! test functions rely on global variables to track operations and anything 
//! non-self-test related operations will clobber these variables, resulting in 
//! self test failures. Make sure no other code uses MbedTLS while running the 
//! self tests. Multiple self test operations done simultaneously may also 
//! return failures.
