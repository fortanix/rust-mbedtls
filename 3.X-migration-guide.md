## Changes:

**Note**: entries with :boom: are ensured that they will break the downstream.


### Changes in `mbedtls-sys-auto`

#### Vendor code changes

**Upstream changes:**

- :boom: Upgrade vendor `mbeldtls` code to `3.4.0`

**Changes on our side:**

- Cherry picked previous changes in old versions:
	- commit: [vendor change: Adding mpi_force_c_code feature](https://github.com/fortanix/rust-mbedtls/pull/213/commits/c8cd4067ff51f2c74cf623e0a42028215a77f883)
- New changes
    - [vendor change: fix time call in tls13 client&server](https://github.com/fortanix/rust-mbedtls/pull/213/commits/bafc52d97bda9963f36b8eefd19a31110e8e5dac) : This has been merged into upstream, see: https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/pull/7639 .

#### rust code changes

**Features:**

- :boom: `zlib` is removed: support for TLS record-level compression is removed in `mbedtls` 3.X
  - Related C DEFINE `MBEDTLS_ZLIB_SUPPORT` is also removed
- :boom: `legacy_protocols` is removed: all protocols early than TLS 1.2 is removed in `mbedtls` 3.X
  - Related C DEFINE's are also removed: `MBEDTLS_SSL_PROTO_SSL3`, `MBEDTLS_SSL_PROTO_TLS1`, `MBEDTLS_SSL_PROTO_TLS1_1`, `MBEDTLS_SSL_CBC_RECORD_SPLITTING`
- :boom: `pkcs11` is removed: wrapper for `libpkcs11-helper` is removed in `mbedtls` 3.X, see [3.0-migration-guide.md](https://github.com/fortanix/rust-mbedtls/blob/yx/upgrade-mbedtls/mbedtls-sys/vendor/docs/3.0-migration-guide.md#remove-wrapper-for-libpkcs11-helper)
- :boom: `pkcs12` is removed: because https://github.com/fortanix/rust-mbedtls/pull/269
- Put TLS 1.3 behind a feature `tls13` : because the dependency of TLS 1.3 in mbedtls 3.X are using a global state RNG which breaks the requirements for FIPS, so this feature enables use to avoid these code from compilation.
- :boom: Deprecated features  `custom_threading` , `custom_time` , `custom_gmtime_r` , `pthread`  are removed

**Dependencies:**

- :boom: Bump `mbedtls-sys` version to `3.4.0`
- :boom: Deprecated dependencies are removed
  - `libz-sys` : support for TLS record-level compression is removed in `mbedtls` 3.X
  - `libc`: `libc` is not needed in `sgx`

**Build code changes:**

Following changes are made according to [3.0-migration-guide.md](https://github.com/fortanix/rust-mbedtls/blob/yx/upgrade-mbedtls/mbedtls-sys/vendor/docs/3.0-migration-guide.md).

- Remove `MBEDTLS_CONFIG_H` in `mbedtls_config.h`
- Remove `#include <mbedtls/check_config.h>`
- `mbedtls-sys/build/bindgen.rs`
	-  Allow `bindgen` to generate bindings for functions, types and variables start with `psa_`, and put them in a sub `mod psa` because they are needed by TLS 1.3
	- Use  `bindgen` experiment feature to generate C function wrapper for C `static inline` functions
- `mbedtls-sys/build/headers.rs` : Update header files
- `mbedtls-sys/build/config.rs` : Remove/add C defines
	- :boom: Added `MBEDTLS_PSA_CRYPTO_EXTERNAL_RNG` : this is added because TLS 1.3 need to use PSA library which need this when feature `std` is off, user need to provide their implementation. In `rus-mbedtls`, one implementation is proveded, see: `mbedtls/src/rng/mod.rs`.

### Changes in `mbedtls-platform-support`

- Added `once_cell` for initializing PSA only one times: see `fn psa_crypto_init()` in `mbedtls-platform-support/src/lib.rs`, this is needed because:
	- > MBEDTLS_USE_PSA_CRYPTO means that X.509 and TLS will use PSA Crypto as much as possible (that is, everywhere except for features that are not supported by PSA Crypto, see "Internal Changes" below for a complete list of exceptions). When it is enabled, you need to call psa_crypto_init() before calling any function from PK, X.509 or TLS;
	- Ref: https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/blob/0b3de6fcec4aa4b23a9ee1e076714cbc796f3ac4/docs/use-psa-crypto.md#general-considerations
- Add function pointer `mbedtls_psa_external_get_random`  which is needed when C DEFINE option `MBEDTLS_PSA_CRYPTO_EXTERNAL_RNG` is turned on. This will be used in case when system default RNG or entropy is no available (for example in SGX)
    - Using function pointer here ensure there is no link time conflict in future when mutiple `rust-mbedtls` is using this crate.
    - User need to call function `set_psa_external_rng_callback` before using any PSA functions or TLS 1.3
- Add rust implementation of `explicit_bzero`, which is needed in SGX. Because in SGX, our [rs-libc](https://github.com/fortanix/rust-sgx/tree/master/rs-libc) does not support this function.
- Update self tests:
  - following are removed:
    - arc4_self_test
    - md2_self_test
    - md4_self_test
    - x509_self_test
    - xtea_self_test
  - following are added:
    - sha384_self_test
    - chacha20_self_test
    - chachapoly_self_test
    - poly1305_self_test
    - sha224_self_test

### Changes in `mbedtls`

**Features:**

- :boom: `zlib`, `legacy_protocols` removed to sync with changes in `mbedtls-sys`
- :boom: `pkcs12` and `pkcs12_rc2` are removed: see https://github.com/fortanix/rust-mbedtls/pull/269
- Put TLS 1.3 logic behind a feature `tls13`: check reason above

**Dependencies:**

- :boom: Bump `rust-mbedtls` version to `0.11.0`
- :boom: Bump dependency `mbedtls-sys-auto` version to `3.4.0`
- Added `rstest` `rstest_reuse` `lazy_static` `env_logger`: used for improving code of tests


### Code changes

- Function `EcPoint::mul` now need to pass in a RNG to ensure blinding.
- Add prefix `private_` to some fields of `mbedtls` types under `mbedtls/src/cipher/raw`
- :boom: Removed and added some options in `Error`, `CipherType`, `CipherMode` and `CipherSuite`  to sync with changes in `mbedtls` 3.X
- :boom: `mbedtls/src/pk/ec.rs` : User need to provide a RNG callback for function `EcPoint::mul`, this originally is not a hard requirement, but in C `mbedtls` 3.X this become a hard requirement for blinding to defend side channel attack.
- :boom: `mbedtls/hash` :
	- `Md2` and `Md4` are removed since they are no longer supported in `mbedtls` 3.X
	- fn `pbkdf_pkcs12` is removed since `pkcs12` is removed
- :boom: `mbedtls/pk/mod.rs` :
	- Remove `CustomPk`
	- User need to provide a RNG callback for `Pk::from_private_key`, this originally is not a hard requirement, but in C `mbedtls` 3.X this become a hard requirement for blinding to defend side channel attack.
- :boom: `mbedtls/src/ssl/ciphersuites.rs`: Rename `TlsCipherSuite` to `Tls12CipherSuite`, and add enum: `Tls13CipherSuite`, `IanaTlsNamedGroup`, `TLS13SignatureAlgorithms`: these are introduced by TLS 1.3
- `mbedtls/src/ssl/ssl_states.rs`: Add `SslStates` to represent the state of SSL handshake
- Update tests accordingly

**Special code need to notice**:

In `impl` of `std::io::Read` under `mbedtls/src/ssl/io.rs` and `tokio::io::AsyncRead` under `mbedtls/src/ssl/async_io.rs`, there are some code to handle the special case when using `mbedtls` as `client` to connect to a server whose `session ticket` extension is enabled.

This case is found when connecting to `goolge.com`, where Google's server send the `session ticket` after the completion of handshake, which cause `C-mbedtls` throw errors when client is try to read msg data.

## CI changes

- Use [cargo-nextest](https://nexte.st/#cargo-nextest) to run tests
	- Reduce time to run tests
	- Have ability to run some tests in serial
		- tests under `hyper.rs` need to access to `google.com` which has QPS limit
		- some tests function use some system resource, see https://github.com/fortanix/rust-mbedtls/blob/yx/upgrade-mbedtls/mbedtls/tests/support/net.rs
